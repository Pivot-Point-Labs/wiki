    A script that requires users to log into Patreon and verify their subscription to make the map playable. The check will be valid for a few days (up to the track author) to a maximum of a month (Patreons maximum auth-token lifetime).

## 3D Audio

<p>
    <video controls style="float: left; height: 150px; width: auto; margin-right: 15px;">
        <source src="../../assets/3daudio.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    A script that creates 3D audio sources with min-max distances, cone, volume, and balance options. 
    This is made to replace the heavy FMOD system that a lot of people donâ€™t know how to use. 
    It also generates enormous file sizes while my script can play any audio file (even remotely!).

## 3D Fake Interior Shader

This shader can be used as a texture to emulate a room without using any geometry. The shader uses clever math and parallax to imitate real perspective.
