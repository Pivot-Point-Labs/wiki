At Pivot Point Labs, we create custom Assetto Corsa tracks, as well as scripts that integrate seamlessly with your map — eliminating the need for a separate app (But if you need an app, we build those too). Our maps bring a unique and immersive experiences to the game while showcasing our scripts in action.

Whether you need a custom script or want to purchase an existing one, we’ve got you covered. Some scripts are free, while premium options are encrypted to ensure they work exclusively with your map.

The possibilities with scripting are limitless, and many developers have yet to tap into their full potential. We’ve already built features such as:

- Real-time ingame leaderboards that track the fastest times across all servers and even single-player.
- Drift entry go/no-go lights that detect approaching cars for seamless tandem runs.
- Dynamic pedestrian systems with animated characters and customizable walkways.

With scripting, you can modify cars, environments, physics, UI elements, and much more—often in ways that go beyond the game’s default interactions. These effects can even be synchronized across multiplayer servers, single-player sessions, or all players worldwide.

If you can imagine it, we can build it. Let’s push the limits of Assetto Corsa together.
