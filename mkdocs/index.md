# Welcome!

I make custom assetto corsa script that you can ship with your map instead of an app (but i make apps too ðŸ™‚)! If you need or want to buy a script, hit me up. Some are free, others are paid. Paid script will be encrypted and can not be run on other maps!

Anything is possible with scripts. Most people dont know their potential yet. A leaderboard that (realtime) updates fastest times across all servers (and even singleplayer) to show the fastest time driven by any player, a drift go/no-go entry light that checks if other cars are currently driving close to the entry and an entire pedestrian system with animated peds and dynamic & highly customizable walkways - all things i have already done.

You can mess with cars, the world, physics, UI elements and anything else you can imagine in ways they dont usually interact with. This can even be synchronized across all people playing on a server, singleplayer or all players worldwide. There are truly no limits!
